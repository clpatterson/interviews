### Hash Tables
* Performance:
	* O(1) insertion, lookup, and deletion
* Use Cases:
	* When you only need to store and lookup objects (using keys, not values)
	* When you need to partition a list of objects into distinct groups by some property (basically what a group by in sql does) ***research this***
	* When you need to count the number of distinct items in a list ***research this***
* Explanation
	* Hash table
		* Definition: a collection of items stored in such a way you can quickly look up values for a given key. Hash tables are built on top of arrays.
	* Hash functions
		* Definition: hash functions take a key as input and map that key to an array index in a hash table using a mapping algorithm.
		* Remainder method
		* Folding method
		* Mid-square method 
	* Hash collision resolution
		* Linear probing
		* Quadratic probing
		* Chaining
